                <p>Written below is a brief summary of the skills I picked up during my time at Kenna</p>
                <h4>Employer Description</h4>
                <p>Kenna is a "one stop shop" for businesses, meaning it provides a large suite of services for its clients, including applications development, accounts, marketing, and more. Kenna is a child company of Stagwell, in charge of calculating incentives and rewards for farmers to recieve if they meet the right criteria. The division I was in focused on creating web applications to assist with the calculation of incentive payments, and displaying information about each client.</p>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>The goals I set for this work term were to become proficient in Lotus Notes, gain SQL experience, and to problem solve. I believe I succeeded in these goals as despite having little experience with SQL and no experience with Lotus Notes, I was able to become comfortable working with both by the end of the semester as well as becoming able to close tickets accurately and at a quick pace. At the start of the workterm, I had never even heard of half the SQL functionality Kenna used, and by the end of the work term I was able to write SQL from scratch, as well as debug complicated procedures. Lastly, my problem solving skills improved, as I was working mostly independant with my supervisors acting as guides if I needed help. My employers trusted me to get work done accurately with minimal supervision.</p>
                <h4>Job Description</h4>
                <p>During the work term, I worked on two different projects. The first project was creating a modern rework of an existing tool, which had become quite messy over the many years it existed. I worked on this project for about 3 weeks, before switching over to help with a large backlog of tickets for a different project. I worked on this project for the remainder of the semester, doing a combination of fixing old bugs, and creating new features in accordance to business requirements.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>In conclusion, during my time working for Kenna, I was able to learn a lot about a more corporate structure of programming, as well as gain valuble industry skills.</p>
