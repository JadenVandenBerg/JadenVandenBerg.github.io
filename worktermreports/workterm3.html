                <p>Written below is a brief summary of the skills I picked up during my time at Kenna</p>
                <h4>Employer Description</h4>
                <p>Kenna is a "one stop shop" for businesses, meaning it provides a large suite of services for its clients, including applications development, accounts, marketing, and more. Kenna is a child company of Stagwell, in charge of calculating incentives and rewards for farmers to recieve if they meet the right criteria. The division I was in focused on creating web applications to assist with the calculation of incentive payments, and displaying information about each client.</p>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>At my second term at Kenna, I set the following goals: 1. Become proficient in understanding Kenna's codebase. 2. Become proficient in React. 3. Gain proficiency in problem solving.</p>
                <h4>Job Description</h4>
                <p>During this work term, I worked on a variety of projects, demonstrating my ability to adapt my code writing to working in different environments. The first thing I worked on were some outstanding requests for their "Call Center Application", an application that the Call Team uses to keep track of call logs and outstanding calls. My work on this project was minimal, as it was assigned to me mainly to keep me busy until more work was scheduled for me to do later. I worked on adding new features and fixing bugs primarily. One thing I worked on that demonstrated my skills was when I made improvements to the search functionality. Before my improvements, the functionality worked by first searching for an exact match of first name, last name, and company. Next it would search for exact first name, similar last name, and exact company, and so on. This approach ran the same query many times with only minor adjustments to the query, and I was able to adjust this in order to make it much more efficient, and more maintainable at the same time. This demonstrated my problem solving goal, as I had to think of how to improve on slow code, and I wasn't directly told what to do or how to do it. Additionally, my front-end bugfixing allowed me to gain understanding of React.js, which the project uses. Unfortunately, I didn't do any more react work for the rest of the semester, which was different from the original plan set by my supervisor due to lack of work needed, but I still did enough to gain a base understanding.</p>
                <br /><p>The next main project I worked on was migrating one of their older projects to a modern codebase for future maintainability reasons. I was responsible for moving the backend from Lotus Notes Agents to Node.js/SQL Server. This project helped me acheive my goal of gaining proficienty in Kennas codebase as I had to understand both their older systems and the structure they wanted for their newer projects. Additionally, I gained a deep understanding of proper Node.js client to SQL server communications, which turned out being much more complicated when done correctly than I initially thought. My main work here consisted of converting Lotus Notes Agents into equivalent SQL procedures, and then writing Node.js functionality to call those SQL procedures. Working on this helped me develop as a backend developer, as I worked on the entire backend for this project.</p>
                <br /><p>After that was completed, I began work on my next project, updating the grids on Kennas "Interaction Tracker" web app. The old grids had several problems, the worst of which overloaded the server with requests if the user scrolled too fast. This was due to the functionality of when the grid asks the server for the current page of data was poorly written, and if someone scrolled too fast, it would load slowly. Instead of just updating this functionality, my supervisor thought it best to replace the entire grid with something more standardized accross their other applications. I used Kendo UI, a JQuery based widget library for the grid to get this job done. This helped me gain a deeper proficiency in JQuery, as well as reading documentation to understand how to do things, as using this library was brand new to me.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>In conclusion, during my time working for Kenna, I was able to learn a lot about a more corporate structure of programming, as well as gain valuble industry skills.</p>
