                <p>Written below is a breif summary of the skills I picked up during my time at the University of Guelphs Bean Breeding Program</p>
                <h4>Employer Description</h4>
                <p>The University of Guelphs Bean Breeding Program aims to develop new dry bean varieties for Ontario farmers and farmers around the world. Beans are bred for positive traits such as high yield, low days to maturity, and resistance to common diseases. The University of Guelphs Bean Breeding program ships beans to countries all over the world. It is estimated that 90% of dark red kidney beans planted in Ontario are Dynasty, one of the programs beans.</p>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>The goals I set were to become proficient in Excel, design a website that can be easily updated when I'm gone, and to improve my problem solving skills. I would say I completed all my goals. When I started the job, I had never actually used Excel, but at the end of the job I was able to write relatively complex VBA scripts in order to automate the workflow. Similarly, I made guides for adding website content so my employer can easily update information about the beans that can be found on the website annually. My problem solving skills also improved, as I worked independently for a large percentage of my job, often being the only one in the office while the rest of the team was at one of the programs physical field locations. I often was given requirements for projects, but it was up to me to decide how to design the program to meet said requirements.</p>
                <h4>Job Description</h4>
                <p>My job was mainly to design a website for the program, and to create Excel VBA scripts to automate time consuming tasks that had to be done multiple times annually. Some skills required were HTML/CSS/JS, and Excel/VBA. I learned HTML/CSS in class, already knew all the JavaScript I needed from personal experience, and learned Excel/VBA on the job. Another part of my job was working with grad students to add data collected from their work on their theses to Borealis (A large academic database).</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>In conclusion, during my time working for the University of Guelphs Plant Agriculture department, I gained many hard skills such as Excel and VBA, but also many soft skills such as communication, and problem solving.</p>
